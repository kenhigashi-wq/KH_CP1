# VL 2nd Integers and Floats Notes

# Integers
# Integers are whole numbers, both positive and negative, including zero.
a = 10        # positive integer
b = -5        # negative integer    
c = 0         # zero

#Floats(floating point numbers)
# Floats are numbers that have a decimal point.
x = 3.14      # positive float  
y = -2.71     # negative float
z = 0.0       # zero as a float

# Arithmetic Operations
sum_result = a + b          # Addition
diff_result = a - b         # Subtraction
prod_result = a * b         # Multiplication
div_result = a / 2          # Division (results in float)
int_div_result = a // 3     # Integer Division (results in integer, whole number from division)
mod_result = a % 3          # Modulus (remainder, whole #)
exp_result = a ** 2         # Exponentiation
