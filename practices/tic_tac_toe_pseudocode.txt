# Import random module
# Initialize player and computer scores to 0
# Set the board by setting x in range
#Then add the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

while True:
    #Ask the player to input their choice (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
    # Also set the variable for the choices so you can set the conditional. Very IMPORTANT
    #While the input is not valid (not 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9):
        #Ask the player to input a valid choice

    # Use random.choice to select computer's choice from [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    # If choice varaicle is crossing with computer choice make the computer repeat the process above
    #Print players choice
